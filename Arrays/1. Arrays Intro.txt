// An array is a collection of elements of the SAME TYPE placed in CONTIGUOUS MEMORY LOCATIONS
// Every element is of size of the data type.
// a[i] === *(a+i)

int a[100];
// Static allocation memory of 100 integers. 4*100 = 400 bytes

int b[100] = {0};
// Initializing the array with all zeroes. The above array will have garbage.

int c[] = {1, 2, 3};
// List allocation. Three elemets would be 1,2,3

int d[100] = {1, 2, 3};
// First three elements would be 1,2,3 rest 97 would be 0

string fruits[4] = {"apple", "mango", "guava"};
// Array of string where each string is also an array. So it is a kind of 2D array
